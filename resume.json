As I've started from scratch and grinded my proffesional skills, I've had the chance to grow with the company itself during a period of almost 3 years and to work on a variety of project ideeas and uitility, such as:",
      "highlights": ["Ecommerce - Worked on 2 projects here, one about selling car parts via an online shop and the other an airline company. For each of them I was working outsourced, mainly for updates on the already existing apps, such as new features or additions. On a daily basics you would work with mostly internal frameworks used across multiple projects, abstractisation being a key element; the apps were CMS driven, the client could this way to make a change without the need of shipping a new build.", "Bluetooth Low Energy - I've had a very pleasant experience with IoT domain; since the client had lots of lighting devices, they've added a BLE chip to them in order to be controlled via an application. The app itself was supposed to do the job of a whole console, such as pairing, grouping, applying a variety of animations with different colours, intensities and frequencies, exporting/importing configurations from one device to another and so on. The offline storage and reactive programming were mainly used since we had to store somehow all the data about devices and interuptions with on hold/resume states could occur from different reasons.", "Video industry - Here's about 2 other outsourcing projects, basically focused on video and live streaming. Used the UICompositionalLayout for multiple scroll collections with different types of content cells. Content was section driven on the backend response, applying a type depending on the response we've got back. Worked with video players, overlayers, picture in picture, advertisments and analytics.", "Mental health - It was a start-up ideea, but the app was a blasting, having a great success; it was focused on journaling, bullet journey, habit and mood tracking, meditation, etc. I've gathered knwoledge about using different types of charts, animations and transitions, sound players and could/in-app messages.", "User tracking movement - The app wass supposed to be used during marathons or races. You could buy tickets to different tournaments within the app either for participating or watching live/offline the other participants. The version I worked on was focused on the latter one; the user could observe on a map multiple participants, the track with different layers depending on the event and highlight various aspects to focus during the watch time. Used MapKit mostly, but also Maps (by Apple) and GoogleMaps.", "Local or internal projects - These were the first projects I've been working on. I've was manly focused on UI components and flow navigations. Had the chance to work on the basics, as UI, netoworking and architecture."]
